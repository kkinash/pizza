# Pizza Planet: Online Ordering and Delivery Website
As part of my PHP Advanced course, I successfully completed the final test, which involved creating a website for ordering pizzas online and having them delivered to customers' homes. The main objective of the project was to expand the services of a pizzeria by providing an online platform for customers to conveniently order pizzas and enjoy home delivery, while ensuring a seamless experience for on-site diners by excluding the option for pickup orders.

### Key Features

Pizza Overview and Ordering: Visitors, both registered and unregistered, can browse the entire range of pizzas available. They can view product information, including prices, and add pizzas to a virtual shopping cart. The contents of the shopping cart should be visible at all times while browsing the pizza selection for enhanced user-friendliness. Customers can add or remove pizzas from the cart as desired.
Checkout Process: Once satisfied with the cart contents, customers can proceed to the checkout page by clicking the "Checkout" button. If a visitor has already logged in with an existing account, they are redirected to an order summary page (refer to the "Checkout" section). For non-logged-in visitors, the checkout page presents two options:
- "I have an account": Customers can enter their email address and password associated with their existing account. Upon entering the correct credentials, the visitor is automatically logged in and redirected to the order summary page.
- "I don't have an account": Visitors are prompted to provide their name, address, postcode, city, and phone number. An option to create a new account using these details is also available (in this case, an email address and password are required). After providing the necessary information, visitors are automatically directed to the checkout page. Order Summary: At this stage, the customer is presented with an overview page displaying all the details of the order, including the total price. It's important to note that home delivery may not be available in all areas. If a customer enters a postcode that is not eligible for delivery, they receive an error message. Additionally, the order summary page includes links for customers to update their address details or modify the shopping cart contents.
